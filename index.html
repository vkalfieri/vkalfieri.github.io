                    <p>
Currently Vic lives in a small town, with his wife, Shannon, and their sometimes friendly black and white cat.

On weekends Vic works at a liquor store; but plans to change this with a Diploma of I.T. 
This intensive boot-camp style course, has taught him a number of software development languages. 
Which he plans to use to become a junior developer. He also has ideas for apps/services that he plans to build.
Vic is interested in front-end development and UX/UI/design and plans to use the course to learn these skills 
and hone skills already learned through previous studies with Kangan Institute of TAFE in the Advanced Diploma of 
Computer Systems Engineering.
                    </p><p>
Other studies: Cert. IV Professional Writing and Editing - which he uses to occasionally 
<a href="http://drfunk81.wixsite.com/wordherderediting">freelance</a> as an editor.
He has also come close to having a picture book
<a href="http://discovic.deviantart.com/art/At-Number-Seven-Brimblecombe-Drive-parts-one-and-2-343594093">manuscript</a> published with Random House. Creativity plays a big part in his life. 
He writes (obviously.) He draws (not very well.) 
And reads extensively (and occasionally <a href="http://randfand.blogspot.com.au/2014/07/hello-and-welcome-to-first-blog-for.html">publishes</a>) 
blogs and books about his hobbies and interests. 
Those include, but are not limited to: technology, gadgets, creative pursuits, music, and pop culture.

This is a project I worked on as part of my training with Coder Academy, written in Ruby:<p>
<a href="https://github.com/vkalfieri/pilltracker">A Simple Pill Tracker</a></p>

Here's a quick video of it in action:<p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dgeH5KAP8WA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>And here's another project completed at Coder Academy: It's a two-sided marketplace (written in Ruby on Rails) 
    platform that was done as part of my training with Coder Academy:</p>

<p><a href="https://glacial-thicket-20341.herokuapp.com/">Swapdeck - Collector Card Trading Site</a></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vkalfieri/Swapdeck">And it's associated repository on GitHub</a> 
    the splash page needs to be updated, but the site essentially works properly.</p> 

And my final project created while I studied at Coder Academy:

<a href="https://finalprojectbwsfoodwine.netlify.com/">A wine and food matching and cocktail recipe guide</a>

More content will be added soon...stay tuned...</p>
