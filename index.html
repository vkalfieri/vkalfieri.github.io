<hr><h3>A Bit About Me:</h3><hr>
Currently Vic lives in a small town, with his wife, Shannon,
and their sometimes friendly black and white cat.
<br><br>
On weekends Vic works at a liquor store; but plans to change this with a
Diploma of I.T.
He is currently studying this intensive boot-camp style course, where he is
learning all sorts of software development
languages; with plans to become a junior developer.
He also has ideas for apps/services that he plans to build.
<br><br>
Vic is interested in front-end development and UX/UI/design and plans to use the
course to learn these skills and hone skills already learned through previous
studies with Kangan Institute of TAFE in the Advanced Diploma of Computer Systems
Engineering.
<br><br>
Other studies: Cert. IV Professional Writing and Editing -  which he uses to
occasionally freelance as an editor.
<br><br>
He has also come close to having a picture book manuscript published with
Random House.
<br><br>
Creativity plays a big part in his life. He writes (obviously.) He draws
(not very well.) And reads extensively (and occasionally writes) blogs/books
about his hobbies and interests. Those include, but are not limited to:
technology, gadgets, creative pursuits, music, and pop culture.
<br><br>
...And normally talks about himself in first person.
