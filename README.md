AIM:

My aim was to create a personalised website that showed my style and personality as well as a summary that presented my professional
achievements. I also wanted to use only CSS and HTML as so far we haven't learned any other frameworks or web development languages in
class so far, and though I've done some Javascript work before, I don't recall enough of it and don't feel confident enough to utilise it
for a portfolio where my aim was to present my professional achievements.

SECTIONS:

About:

My aim here was to tell a narrative piece that told the reader about myself and at the same time was a little bit cheeky and reflective of
my personality, while still presenting as a professional introduction to myself and my personality.

Work:

Here I simply shared a pared down version of my work/work experience and study history taken from my current resum√®.

Projects:

There is no content on this page as yet, as I don't feel I have anything worth sharing that I have made with code so far, there is a work
in progress message and it has a short song I made in the meantime until I feel I have something worth sharing.

Skills:

I simply wanted a plain text listing of my skills that showcased what I'm learning and what I have learned in the past.

DESIGN PROCESS:

For ideas and inspiration I looked at Pinterest and used my own ideas for how I wanted to present my website. I was originally going to have
a retro style TV as an animated image in the background that allowed the user the 'turn' the dial and change the 'page' between sections;
but couldn't find a suitable image. I then had the idea of using a blackboard and a chalk-like font as the main theme for my website and
overall design. This was based around the idea that I'm still learning how to do things and that it was a bit of a playful spin on a
traditional website. The image was going to feature throughout the sections, but I instead chose to use a similar style to the old-school
scrolling blackboard from my primary school days where the teacher would pull down on the bottom of the board and reveal a fresh board
on which to write.

I then implemented a 'back to top' button in the form of a chalk outline image linked to the 'home' section.

To layout my ideas I used Figma to create a mockup of the website to see how it would appear on both mobile and desktop platforms. This
was an early build issue as I went to create the actual code; as I did the code for the desktop version first when I began to code and
had to go back and implement the responsive code later on.

BUILDING:

I began with a desktop first approach, and quickly learned that I would have to implement the changes required to make it work on a
mobile platform, and so had to research the css coding to make it work on both platforms. With this hurdle out of the way I went on to
implement other features that would be required for the brief. Such as:

Meta Tags:

I had to add a description, and author and some og tags for title, type, description and image.

CSS:

My main aim was to get a working website, as such, I started to build blindly, and added in the code to make it responsive after the fact.
If I had my time again, I think I would have started with a mobile first approach and then implemented the desktop mode as required.

HTML:

Here again, I simply started from a desktop down approach, instead of a mobile up approach. As above, I would go the other way if I
could start over.

Images/Icons:

I used my own images for the nav 'buttons', and my favicon and name logo, these were all made with a program called The Creator, published
by Laughingbird Software and then uploaded to image hosting website Photobucket, so I could ensure they were available for use as I tested
my code before uploading, and as they were already there, and the code was already written using img tags, I decided to leave this code as
is, rather than upload them to github and spend more time waiting and refactoring code.

For the background image in 'home' section I used a stock photo of a blackboard from pexels.com and for the images of the personal links
under my name in the same section I used iconfinder.com.

Lessons Learned:

Throughout the entire process I would have liked to have had more focus on mobile first and implemented that part of the code straightaway
rather than jumping straight into a desktop oriented design, as this would have saved me time. I also would have done more initial research
and reading to better understand the ins and outs of CSS styling and implementations and limitations.

From where I started with my mockup to where I ended up, I was definitely happy with where I got to with the overall design and feel of
the website. While it may not be overly flashy and probably needs work (both with the code and overall design) I am happy with what I
achieved.

Room for Improvement:

Responsive design for large screens beyond the screen resolution of my laptop.

Removal of scroll-bar from side of screen where the user is required to scroll down the page to read more of each section.

Overall layout and design for a more professional feel, while still maintaining a personal flair.
